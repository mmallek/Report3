\chapter{Historical Range of Variability Results}
\section{Disturbance Regime}

This report focuses on the effects of wildfire as a natural disturbance; the impacts of other natural disturbances during the reference period were likely localized in time or space and therefore probably had far less impact on vegetation patterns over broad spatial and temporal scales than did fire.\todo{Becky: is this true?} In the sections below, we describe the simulated disturbance regime in terms of its spatial extent and distribution, frequency, and temporal variability, for the landscape as a whole. Variations among vegetation types are described in Chapter~\ref{ch:covtype} and in Appendix~\ref{app:covtype_analysis}. We also acknowledge that some results were used to evaluate whether the model was correctly calibrated; specifically, fire rotation values were used in model calibration, as described in Chapter~\ref{ch:methods}. These rotation values are also an outcome of the model, and are therefore reported here. While this may seem a bit circular, it was a necessary part of the process of simulating the historical range of variability. In addition to the disturbance regime, this chapter includes results for the seral stage dynamics and analysis of the landscape configuration metrics from \textsc{Fragstats}.

%Finally, it is important to realize that while the information below is presented as ``results,'' it could have easily been presented in the methods section as ``model calibration.'' Key spatial and temporal aspects of the disturbance regime were evaluated during preliminary calibration runs, and we subsequently adjusted model parameters to effect desired changes. Thus, while the information presented below does in fact represent results (output) of the simulation, it also represents a set of targets used to calibrate the model (i.e., adjust model parameters to achieve desired results). While this may seem a bit circular, it was a necessary process for a complex model such as \textsc{RMLands}. Moreover, our real emphasis was on quantifying the vegetation patterns and dynamics resulting from these disturbance processes. 

\subsection{Disturbed Area}

Approximately 96\% of the landscape was eligible for wildfire disturbance (all cover types except Barren and Water)\footnote{In this section we report values based on percent of eligible landscape. There are 181,550 hectares in the core project area, and 174,830 remain after excluding Barren and Water.}. As expected, the frequency and extent of simulated wildfires varied across timesteps (Figure~\ref{fig:darea}). Also, given the rotation interval and percent mortality expected over time on this landscape, large proportions of the project area burned each (5-year) timestep. High mortality fires do include the burning of early development vegetation, including chaparral, when it resets the successional process. In general, within a given timestep about a third of the disturbed area burned as high mortality. We further summarize the disturbance regime in Tables \ref{tab:darea_atleast} and \ref{tab:darea}. Figures~\ref{fig:darea_min_map}--\ref{fig:darea_mean_map} depict wildfire disturbances during the timesteps representing the $5^{th}$ percentile, $50^{th}$ percentile, $95^{th}$ percentile, and mean area burned.

Sierran Mixed Conifer - Mesic (\textsc{smc\_m}) is the dominant cover type within the core project area, encompassing 57,853 ha and comprising roughly 32\% of the project area.

\subsection{Effect of Climate} 
Climate does have a positive relationship with disturbed area, as expected (Figure \ref{fig:climate_darea}). We show here a fitted line, but note the heteroskedastic variance about the mean. The relationship is weakly positive. During wetter-than-average years, we see less disturbed area. Over 20\% of the landscape burned only in timesteps during which the climate parameter was at least 0.63. However, over 50\% of the landscape burned in several timesteps when the climate parameter was less than 1, which is the average value over the historical period. Overall we observe that as climate shifts from wet to drought, the disturbed area increases. %Climate also has a weak effect on the size of individual fires (Figure \ref{fig:climate_dsize}). 
Fire size is also influenced by vegetation susceptibility and the specified disturbance size distribution. For this reason, large areas may burn in relatively ``wet'' years. Figure \ref{fig:compare_clim_darea} illustrates the climate parameter values and disturbed area proportion of the landscape for a subset of timesteps during the simulation.

\subsection{Effect of Topographic Position}

The topographic position index value for a given cell acts as an input into the susceptibility and mortality values otherwise defined for that cover type and condition class combination. In general, cells with smaller TPI values had reduced susceptibility and mortality. Early development and open canopy conditions tend to result from fire, and we predicted that an increase in fires and in the likelihood of high mortality fire would lead to a decrease in the average canopy cover values for cells with large TPI values. Table~\ref{tab:tpi_cc} in Appendix \ref{app:full-results} displays the results for this simulation for the nine most common cover types. All  show decreased average canopy cover as TPI increases, with the decrease ranging from 5.7\% in xeric mixed evergreen forest to 28.8\% in ultramafic oak-conifer forests. Figure \ref{fig:tpi_cc_smc} shows the plotted data and fitted linear regression line for mesic and xeric sierran mixed conifer forests. Figure \ref{fig:averagecc} is a map displaying average canopy cover across the landscape for the full simulated HRV timeframe, excluding the equilibration period. In general, return intervals and canopy cover varied spatially across the forest and decreased with increasing TPI, reflecting our parameterization, which was based on the theory that higher, more southerly aspects are drier and more susceptible to fires. In mesic mixed conifer forests, canopy cover decreased by about 13\% when comparing minimum to maximum TPI, from an average of 49\% to an average of 43\%. In xeric mixed conifer forests, canopy cover decreased by about 25\% when comparing minimum to maximum TPI, from an average of 36\% to an average of 27\% (Table~\ref{tab:tpi_cc_smc}).

\subsection{Fire Rotation} 
As described in Chapter \ref{ch:methods}, we calibrated the model by adjusting seral stage-specific susceptibility values until the nine cover types with more than 1000 ha extent across the study area were within about 10\% of their target fire rotation. We present here the results for Sierran Mixed Conifer Mesic and Xeric. Full results are presented in Appendix \ref{app:full-results}.

\subsection{Population Return Interval}
Overall, the point-specific return interval (grand mean) for all eligible cells ranged from 17 years to \textgreater 2500 years (cells that never burned during the simulation) for both classes of wildfire mortality (Figure \ref{fig:preturn}). The median return interval across all cover types was 42 years for low mortality fire, 111 year for high mortality fire, and 29 years for any fire. The population return interval plots and maps specific to Sierran Mixed Conifer Mesic and Xeric follow (Figures~\ref{fig:preturn_smcm} and \ref{fig:preturn_smcx}). Under this wildfire regime, the grand mean return interval between fires (of any mortality level) for both of these mixed conifer forest types varied widely from about 17 years to over 500 years, with medians of 28 years (for mesic) and 23 years (for xeric) (Figures~\ref{fig:preturn_smcm} and \ref{fig:preturn_smcx}). The other seven focal cover types\todo{where is this established??} are included in Appendix~\ref{app:full-results}.

\section{Vegetation Response}

\subsection{Landscape Composition} \todo{when I redid the plots I did them starting at year 40. should i redo them with the line added in? can probably modify rmlstats call to do this.}


The seral stage distribution for each cover type varied over time, but did appear to be in dynamic equilibrium. Evidence of both high mortality fire, which triggers a transition to early development conditions for all cover types, and low mortality fire, which can thin a stand and cause a transition to a more open canopy condition (within the same developmental stage), are visible in examining the output grids. Figure \ref{fig:covcondmaps} illustrates these changes for a sequence of four timesteps during the simulation. The exception is the Oak-Conifer Forest and Woodland cover type, which did not appear to reach equilibrium until around timestep 220.\todo{review} The seral stage dynamics and current seral stage distribution plots specific to Sierran Mixed Conifer Mesic and Xeric follow (Figures~\ref{fig:covcond_smcm} and \ref{fig:covcond_smcx}).  We compare the current landscape's seral stage distribution to the simulated distribution and compute the HRV departure index in Figures~\ref{fig:covcond_smcm_boxplots} and \ref{fig:covcond_smcx_boxplots} and in Tables \ref{tab:covcond1} and \ref{tab:covcond2}. Plots and tabular results for the other seven focal types are included in Appendix~\ref{app:full-results}, section~\ref{app:sec:seraldynamics}.

  \label{fig:covcond_smcm}
\end{figure}

The distribution of area among stand conditions within mesic mixed conifer forests fluctuated over time, as expected (Figure~\ref{fig:covcond_smcm}). For example, the percentage of mesic mixed conifer forests in the Early Development condition varied from 8\%--25\%, reflecting the dynamic nature of this cover type (Table~\ref{tab:covcond_smcm}). This condition is currently within the simulated HRV (48$^{\text{th}}$ percentile). Mid Development - Closed was typically the most extensive condition class (22\%-37\%), but most of the condition classes were common throughout the simulation. % for later note dominance of closed canopies

The seral-stage distribution appeared to be in dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the percentage in each stand condition varied about a stable mean). The current seral-stage distribution was never observed under the simulated HRV (Table~\ref{tab:covcond_smcm}). The most notable departures were an increase in Mid Development - Closed and Late Development - Open extent, and a decrease in Mid Development - Moderate extent during the simulated HRV. These condition classes are currently all outside of the simulated HRV. In fact, Late Development - Open is rare on the current landscape (3.6\%), but present in similar proportions to  other classes during the HRV.

\end{figure}

The distribution of area among stand conditions within xeric mixed conifer forests fluctuated over time, as expected (Figure~\ref{fig:covcond_smcx}). For example, the percentage of xeric mixed conifer forests in the Early Development varied from 25\% to 43\%, reflecting the dynamic nature of this cover type (Table~\ref{tab:covcond_smcx}). During the simulation, Early Development (which includes post-fire chaparral fields) and Mid Development - Open conditions dominated, in contrast to the current distribution, which is somewhat even across classes (although late development, open canopy stands are currently quite rare).  %

The seral-stage distribution appeared to be in dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the percentage in each stand condition varied about a stable mean). The current seral-stage distribution was never observed under the simulated HRV (Table~\ref{tab:covcond_smcx}). In fact, only Late Development - Moderate had a distribution within the simulated HRV (at the $94^{\text{th}}$ percentile). The most dramatic departure was the increase in Early Development and Mid Development - Open during the simulated HRV compared to the current landscape (currently at 19\% and 11\%, respectively). We also observed a much lower proportion of xeric mixed conifer forest in Late Development - Closed during the simulation than in the current landscape (25\%).

\subsection{Landscape Configuration}
One of the principal purposes of gaining a better quantitative understanding of the historic reference period is to know whether recent human activities have caused landscapes to move outside their historic range of variability (Landres et al.1999, Swetnam et al. 1999). We summarized the structure and patterns in the landscape using a suite of statistical measures calculated using \textsc{Fragstats}. Table \ref{tab:fragland} shows the range of variability for the simulation period as well as the current value, SRV percentile for the current value (``Current SRV Percentile''), and the departure index. We show here a subset of metrics most useful for understanding patch characteristics in the study area. See Appendix \ref{app:metricdescriptions} for a detailed description of \textsc{Fragstats} metrics. At the landscape-level, most computed metrics have values outside the HRV. In Figures \ref{fig:fragland_areashape}, \ref{fig:fragland_contagsiei}, and \ref{fig:fragland_core} we highlight a further subset of the metrics from Table \ref{tab:fragland} for the purposes of discussing the landscape under the simulated historic period as compared to the present day. %Figures for all metrics are included in \todo{the appendix?}. *I don't think we need to include all the figures


%%% Decided that this departure index didn't make sense
%The departure index indicates the distance from the 50$^{\text{th}}$ percentile value. This provides an uncapped index, allowing for interpretation of ``how far'' outside the 90\% range of variability a current landscape metric is. 
%If the current value is less than the median from the simulation, the departure index is given by:
%$$ \frac{ \text{observed} - \text{median} }{ \text{median} - 5^{th} \text{percentile} }  $$
%If the current value is greater than the median from the simulation, the departure index is given by:
%$$ \frac{ \text{observed} - \text{median} }{95^{th} \text{percentile} - \text{median}  }  $$
%If the current value is outside the HRV, its departure index value will be greater than 100 or less than -100.

\todo{Include class-level metrics?}[SMC] The spatial configuration of stand conditions fluctuated markedly over time as well, although there was considerable variation in the magnitude of variability among configuration metrics (Appendix \ref{sec:full-class-results}). Area-weighted patch and core area, as well as edge density, exhibited the greatest variability over time. Four of the seven condition classes consistently fell near or beyond the HRV for the focal metrics. Early development, middle development moderate and open canopy, and late development open canopy cover are currently characterized by smaller, less aggregated, and less geometrically complex patches with less core area than the same condition classes during the simulated HRV. Late development, closed canopy patches trend weakly in the opposite direction, while the remaining conditions typically fall within the HRV.
