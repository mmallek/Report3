abstract = {The Kyoto protocol has focused the attention of the public and policymarkers on the earth's carbon (C) budget. Previous estimates of the impacts of vegetation change have been limited to equilibrium snapshots that could not capture nonlinear or threshold effects along the trajectory of change. New models have been designed to complement equilibrium models and simulate vegetation succession through time while estimating variability in the C budget and responses to episodic events such as drought and fire. In addition, a plethora of future climate scenarios has been used to produce a bewildering variety of simulated ecological responses. Our objectives were to use an equilibrium model (Mapped Atmosphere–Plant–Soil system, or MAPSS) and a dynamic model (MC1) to (a) simulate changes in potential equilibrium vegetation distribution under historical conditions and across a wide gradient of future temperature changes to look for consistencies and trends among the many future scenarios, (b) simulate time-dependent changes in vegetation distribution and its associated C pools to illustrate the possible trajectories of vegetation change near the high and low ends of the temperature gradient, and (c) analyze the extent of the US area supporting a negative C balance. Both models agree that a moderate increase in temperature produces an increase in vegetation density and carbon sequestration across most of the US with small changes in vegetation types. Large increases in temperature cause losses of C with large shifts in vegetation types. In the western states, particularly southern California, precipitation and thus vegetation density increase and forests expand under all but the hottest scenarios. In the eastern US, particularly the Southeast, forests expand under the more moderate scenarios but decline under more severe climate scenarios, with catastrophic fires potentially causing rapid vegetation conversions from forest to savanna. Both models show that there is a potential for either positive or negative feedbacks to the atmosphere depending on the level of warming in the climate change scenarios.},

@article{Knapp2013,
abstract = {In many forests of the western US, increased potential for fires of uncharacteristic intensity and severity is frequently attributed to structural changes brought about by fire exclusion, past land management practices, and climate. Extent of forest change and effect on understory vegetation over time are not well understood, but such information is useful to forest management focused on restoring biodiversity and resilience to these ecosystems. We re-measured three large (4ha) historical "Methods of Cutting" (MC) plots in mixed-conifer forest of the central Sierra Nevada installed in 1929 to evaluate the effects of different logging methods. Trees ???10cm were surveyed across the entire plots and understory vegetation (tree seedlings, shrubs, and herbaceous species) was quantified within quadrats in the old-growth condition in 1929 prior to logging, later in 1929 after logging, and again in 2007 or 2008. We also compared forest structure in the MC plots with an adjacent unlogged "control" area and collected fire scar samples from nearby stumps to evaluate the historical fire regime. The contemporary tree density in the MC plots (739treesha-1) was 2.4times greater than the 1929 pre-logging density (314treesha-1). Trees in the small and intermediate size classes (10-75cmdbh) were significantly over-represented, and trees in the larger size classes (>90cmdbh) generally significantly under-represented, compared with historical conditions. The proportion of pine dropped from 37\% of tree basal area in 1929 to 21\% in 2007/08. Density of small to intermediate sized trees was similar in the contemporary logged and unlogged control plots, suggesting that over the long term, ingrowth may have been influenced more by lack of fire than historical logging. Change to non-tree vegetation was most pronounced for shrub cover, which averaged 28.6\% in 1929 but only 2.5\% in 2008. CART analysis indicated that the highest shrub cover in 1929 was in areas having four or fewer trees growing within 15m to the south of the quadrat, suggesting that reduced light was the most likely explanation for the decline over time. Herbaceous species richness in 2008 was significantly lower than in 1931, two years after logging, but did not differ significantly from 1929, prior to logging. Understory vegetation should benefit from thinning or prescribed fire treatments that lead to a greater abundance of higher light environments within stands. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Fire contributes to the maintenance of species diversity in many plant com- munities, but few studies have compared its impacts in similar communities that vary in such attributes as soils and productivity.We compared how a wildfire affected plant diversity in chaparral vegetation on serpentine and sandstone soils. We hypothesized that because biomass and cover are lower in serpentine chaparral, space and light are less limiting, and therefore postfire increases in plant species diversity would be lower than in sandstone chaparral. In 40 pairs of burned and unburned 250-m2 plots, we measured changes in the plant community after a fire for three years. The diversity of native and exotic species increased more in response to fire in sandstone than serpentine chaparral, at both the local (plot) and regional (whole study) scales. In serpentine compared with sandstone chaparral, specialized fire-dependent species were less prevalent, mean fire severity was lower, mean time since last fire was longer, postfire shrub recruitment was lower, and regrowth of biomass was slower. Within each chaparral type, the responses of diversity to fire were positively correlated with prefire shrub cover and with a number of measures of soil fertility. Fire severity was negatively related to the postfire change in diversity in sandstone chaparral, and unimodally related to the postfire change in diversity in serpentine chaparral. Our results suggest that the effects of fire on less productive plant communities like serpentine chaparral may be less pronounced, although longer lasting, than the effects of fire on similar but more productive communities.},
